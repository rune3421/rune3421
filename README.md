- 👋 Hi, I’m @rune3421
- 👀 I’m interested in finding out how to engage High School students in online learning - and moonlight as an IOT data analyst. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Analysis through the Google certificate series so I can figure out how to get the answer to the above question from the data. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on analysing High School student performance, engagement and user ratings across multiple online learning methods. 
- 📫 How to reach me; through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karl-ernsberger-92690541/), Github or [Remotehub](https://www.remotehub.com/karl.ernsberger)
