- 👋 Hi, I’m @rune3421
- 👀 I’m interested in finding out how to engage High School students in online learning - better. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Analysis through the Google certificate series so I can figure out how to get the answer to the above question from the data. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on analysing High School student performance, engagement and user ratings across multiple online learning methods. 
- 📫 How to reach me; through GitHub or RStudio community. As I get more into the process, I'll start opening up more communication avenues.
